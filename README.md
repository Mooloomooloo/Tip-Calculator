## Notes

This application took a considerable amount of time because I was new to all of the 
languages (HTML, CSS, PHP) used in application. I started learning these languages through 
webistes including php.net, codeacademy.com, and w3schools.com. I began
the application a bit late, so I am definitely go back to review a lot of what 
I read. A problem I encountered was that my WAMP doesn't open the projects from localhost. 
TA Tejen helped point that out as a possible as to why my php code wasn't working.
Overall, this was challenging but great learning experience.
